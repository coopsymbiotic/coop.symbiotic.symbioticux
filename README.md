Coop SymbioTIC user experience hacks for CiviCRM
================================================

This module is used for internal purposes, it is not recommended
for the community at large, unless you know what you are doing.
We hope it can be used for tests, inspiration and eventually to be
integrated in a future version of CiviCRM.
